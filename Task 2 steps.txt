 step-by-step guide for the provided program:

Step 1: Import Required Libraries

Import the necessary libraries: PIL (Python Imaging Library) for handling images and numpy for numerical operations.
Step 2: Define Encryption Function

Define the encrypt_image function which takes the path of the input image, the encryption key, and the path to save the encrypted image.
Open the image using PIL and convert it into a numpy array.
Apply the encryption operation to each pixel by XORing the pixel values with the key.
Create an encrypted image from the encrypted pixel array and save it.
Step 3: Define Decryption Function

Define the decrypt_image function which takes the path of the encrypted image, the decryption key, and the path to save the decrypted image.
Open the encrypted image using PIL and convert it into a numpy array.
Apply the decryption operation to each pixel by XORing the pixel values with the key.
Create a decrypted image from the decrypted pixel array and save it.
Step 4: User Interaction Loop

Start a while loop to repeatedly ask the user whether they want to encrypt, decrypt, or quit.
If the user chooses to quit, exit the program.
If the input is neither 'e', 'd', nor 'q', prompt the user to enter a valid choice.
Ask the user for the image file path, the folder path to save the result, the name for the result file, and the encryption/decryption key.
Call the appropriate function (encrypt_image or decrypt_image) based on the user's choice, passing the required parameters.
Step 5: Handle File Paths

Combine the folder path and file name to get the full save path using os.path.join().
Step 6: Run the Program

Execute the while loop to interact with the user and perform encryption or decryption based on their input.
Step 7: Finish

After the loop ends, print a message indicating the program's exit.
This step-by-step guide provides a clear overview of how the program works and how each part contributes to its functionality.
